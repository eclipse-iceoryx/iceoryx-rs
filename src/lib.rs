//! # iceoryx-rs
//!
//! Eclipse iceoryx is a true zero-copy, inter-process communication framework with the goal to boost
//! autonomous driving with their demand on high data throughput and low latency. With its bandwidth and speed,
//! iceoryx also fits well into other domains where low latency and transmitting large data structures
//! is a concern. If you would like to know more about Eclipse iceoryx you can take a look at the
//! `Getting started` section on [iceoryx.io](https://iceoryx.io) or the
//! [README.md](https://github.com/eclipse-iceoryx/iceoryx/blob/master/README.md) of the main project.
//!
//! The Rust bindings are a work in progress and currently support only the pub-sub messaging pattern.
//! Upcoming releases will close the gap and the goal is to have the Rust bindings as a first class citizen
//! in the iceoryx ecosystem.
//!
//! This project started with the goal to create an awesome looking introspection TUI in Rust and led to
//! [iceray](https://crates.io/crates/iceray). Check it out.
//!
//! # Limitations
//!
//! Currently, only a subset of Eclipse iceoryx v2.0 is supported and some features are missing.
//!
//! - [x] pub-sub messaging pattern
//! - [ ] user defined header for pub-sub data
//! - [ ] request-response messaging pattern
//! - [ ] `Listener` and `WaitSet`
//! - [ ] lookup of available services aka `ServiceDiscovery`
//! - [x] accessing introspection topics like memory usage and available publisher and subscriber
