/// This is a marker trait for types that can be transferred via shared memory.
/// The types must satisfy the following conditions:
/// - no heap is used
/// - the data structure is entirely contained in the shared memory - no pointers
///   to process local memory, no references to process local constructs, no dynamic allocators
/// - the data structure has to be relocatable and therefore must not internally
///   use pointers/references
/// - the type must not impl Drop; drop will not be called when the memory is released since the
///   memory might be located in a shm segment without write access
/// In general, types that could implement the Copy trait fulfill these requirements.
